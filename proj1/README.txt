README         

        This is the README for the programming phase of project 1 for group 7. We have included our own Java code implementations for the following within our submission:
			
                        1.  KThread.java
                        2.  Condition2.java
                        3.  Alarm.java
                        4.  TimeThread.java
                        5.  PriorityQueue.java
                        6.  Communicator.java
                        7.  ReactWater.java

        Our code can be ran by first compiling nachos and then issuing this command while in the proj1 directory.
			
                        ../bin/nachos/ -d jklrC

        j - flag to run the join self tests
        l - flag to run the alarm self tests
        k - flag to run the communicator self tests
        r - flag to run the reactwater self tests
        C - flag to run the cycle self tests
 	
	Running the previous command will run nachos while printing the debug messages for every self test case. These flags can also be individually set and tested:
	
        EX. Testing the Alarm self test

                         ../bin/nachos/ -d l     
	
        Throughout our rigorous testing phase, no quirks, show-stopper bugs, or weird dependencies occurred within our implementation. Everything appears to work as designed.

ADDITIONAL IMPLEMENTATIONS
	
        The PriorityQueue class uses a fully functional MaxHeap structure via ArrayList implementation to simulate a priorityQueue. 
	
                The heap implementation allows for maximum efficiency element sorting: O(logn) vs. the linear O(n) efficiency of the LinkedList implementation
